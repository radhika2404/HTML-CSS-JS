            <h2>Explained: Generative AI
                How do powerful generative AI systems like ChatGPT work, 
                and what makes them different from other types of artificial intelligence?</h2>
                <p>
                    A quick scan of the headlines makes it seem like generative artificial intelligence is everywhere these days. 
                    In fact, some of those headlines may actually have been written by generative AI, like OpenAI\' ChatGPT, 
                    a chatbot that has demonstrated an uncanny ability to produce text that seems to have been written by a human.
                    But what do people really mean when they say “generative AI?”Before the generative AI boom of the past few years,
                    when people talked about AI, typically they were talking about machine-learning models that can learn to make a
                    prediction based on data. For instance, such models are trained, using millions of examples, 
                    to predict whether a certain X-ray shows signs of a tumor or if a particular borrower is likely to default on a loan.
                    Generative AI can be thought of as a machine-learning model that is trained to create new data, 
                    rather than making a prediction about a specific dataset. A generative AI system is one that 
                    learns to generate more objects that look like the data it was trained on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>An increase in complexity </h2>
                    An early example of generative AI is a much simpler model known as a Markov chain. 
                    The technique is named for Andrey Markov, a Russian mathematician who in 1906 introduced 
                    this statistical method to model the behavior of random processes. In machine learning, 
                    Markov models have long been used for next-word prediction tasks, like the autocomplete function in an email program.

            <p>
                <h2>More powerful architectures</h2>
                While bigger datasets are one catalyst that led to the generative AI boom, 
                a variety of major research advances also led to more complex deep-learning architectures.
                In 2014, a machine-learning architecture known as a generative adversarial network (GAN) 
                was proposed by researchers at the University of Montreal. GANs use two models that 
                work in tandem: One learns to generate a target output (like an image) and the other learns 
                to discriminate true data from the generator’s output. The generator tries to fool the discriminator, 
                and in the process learns to make more realistic outputs. The image generator StyleGAN is based
                on these types of models.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>A range of applications</h2>
                What all of these approaches have in common is that they convert inputs into a set of tokens, 
                which are numerical representations of chunks of data. As long as your data can be converted 
                into this standard, token format, then in theory, you could apply these methods to generate new data that look similar.
                “Your mileage might vary, depending on how noisy your data are and how difficult the signal is to extract,
                but it is really getting closer to the way a general-purpose CPU can take in any kind of data and start
                processing it in a unified way,” Isola says.This opens up a huge array of applications for generative AI.
            </p>

                <h2>Raising red flags</h2>
                Generative AI chatbots are now being used in call centers to field questions from human customers, 
                but this application underscores one potential red flag of implementing these models — worker displacement.
                In addition, generative AI can inherit and proliferate biases that exist in training data, or amplify hate 
                speech and false statements. The models have the capacity to plagiarize, and can generate content that looks 
                like it was produced by a specific human creator, raising potential copyright issues.On the other side, 
                Shah proposes that generative AI could empower artists, who could use generative tools to help 
                them make creative content they might not otherwise have the means to produce.
